		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Ground Beef: I used 93% lean ground beef.</li>
			<li>Onion: Dice half of a medium onion.</li>
			<li>Garlic: Mince three cloves.</li>
			<li>
				Tomatoes: You’ll need a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes. My favorite
				brand is Tuttorosso.
			</li>
			<li>Salt: Season the tomatoes.</li>
			<li>
				Noodles: Buy oven-ready lasagna noodles, such as Barilla’s, to make this
				easy lasagna with fewer steps.
			</li>
			<li>
				Eggs: Eggs help bind the cheese mixture in lasagna so it doesn’t run out
				when baked.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cottage Cheese: Use a good-quality part-skim cottage cheese, like Good
				Culture, for extra protein.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mozzarella: Mix some part-skim shredded mozzarella in the lasagna
				filling and sprinkle the remainder on top.
			</li>
			<li>
				Grated Cheese: You’ll need a quarter cup of grated Pecorino Romano
				cheese or Parmesan cheese.
			</li>
			<li>
				Parsley: Add chopped fresh parsley into the cheese mixture and garnish
				with more.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Add the ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large skillet and cook on
				medium-high until the meat is no longer pink. Pour in the crushed
				tomatoes and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan and
				simmer on low heat for 20 minutes, stir a few times.
			</li>
			<li>
				Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl and add the cottage cheese, a half
				cup of mozzarella, Pecorino Romano, and parsley.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spread a cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 13-x-9- inch casserole
				dish, followed by four lasagna noodles, a third of the cheese mixture,
				and a cup of sauce, and repeat. Next, pour the remaining sauce on top
				and sprinkle with the rest of the mozzarella.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cooking time is about 1 hour. Cover the baking dish tight with aluminum
				foil to create steam to cook the noodles, and bake for 55 to 60 minutes
				until the pasta is cooked through. Uncover and cook for another five
				minutes until all the cheese browns slightly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Garnish the lasagna with parsley and let sit for five minutes before
				cutting into eight pieces.
			</li>
		</ol>
