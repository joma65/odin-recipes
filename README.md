Starting The Odin Project after pausing on bootcamp. TOP is more in-depth whereas the bootcamp was starting to be a high level view only. This project is remedial but for breadth of content I will be completing each project in TOP as they come up to solidify what I've learned thus far. I will largely try to limit myself to only what I should conceivably know at the point the project comes up in the curriculum for the sake of digging deeper into each concept.

This project is solely html and focuses on how to use list items and subpages for structure.
